<h1>Welcome to my Java Projects Repository!</h1>

<p>This is a repository for holding Java projects that I have worked on, as well as ongoing projects as well. I look forward to building a variety of applications as I grow and learn more about professional development using Java, as well as related technologies such as Maven and Springboot.</p>
